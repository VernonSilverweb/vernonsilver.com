    <p>Abbott: Strange as it may seem, they give ball players nowadays very peculiar names.</p>

<p>Costello: Funny names?</p>

<p>Abbott: Nicknames, nicknames. Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who&#39;s on first, What&#39;s on second, I Don&#39;t Know is on third--</p>

<p>Costello: That&#39;s what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.</p>

<p>Abbott: I&#39;m telling you. Who&#39;s on first, What&#39;s on second, I Don&#39;t Know is on third--</p>

<p>Costello: You know the fellows&#39; names?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, then who&#39;s playing first?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: I mean the fellow&#39;s name on first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who.</p>

<p>Costello: The fellow playin&#39; first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who.</p>

<p>Costello: The guy on first base.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who is on first.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, what are you askin&#39; me for?</p>

<p>Abbott: I&#39;m not asking you--I&#39;m telling you. Who is on first.</p>

<p>Costello: I&#39;m asking you--who&#39;s on first?</p>

<p>Abbott: That&#39;s the man&#39;s name.</p>

<p>Costello: That&#39;s who&#39;s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?</p>

<p>Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man&#39;s entitled to it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who is?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes.</p>

<p>Costello: So who gets it?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why shouldn&#39;t he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who&#39;s wife?</p>

<p>Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.</p>

<p>Costello: Who does?</p>

<p>Abbott: Absolutely.</p>

<p>Costello: Well, all I&#39;m trying to find out is what&#39;s the guy&#39;s name on first base?</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base.</p>

<p>Costello: I&#39;m not asking you who&#39;s on second.</p>

<p>Abbott: Who&#39;s on first!</p>

<p>Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>Costello: The left fielder&#39;s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why.</p>

<p>Costello: I don&#39;t know, I just thought I&#39;d ask.</p>

<p>Abbott: Well, I just thought I&#39;d tell you.</p>

<p>Costello: Then tell me who&#39;s playing left field?</p>

<p>Abbott: Who&#39;s playing first.</p>

<p>Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder&#39;s name?</p>

<p>Abbott: Why.</p>

<p>Costello: Because.</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, he&#39;s center field.</p>

<p>Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?</p>

<p>Abbott: Wouldn&#39;t this be a fine team without a pitcher?</p>

<p>Costello: Tell me the pitcher&#39;s name.</p>

<p>Abbott: Tomorrow.</p>

<p>Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball--me being a good catcher--I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?</p>

<p>Abbott: Now, that&#39;s he first thing you&#39;ve said right.</p>

<p>Costello: I DON&#39;T EVEN KNOW WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT!</p>

<p>Abbott: Don&#39;t get excited. Take it easy.</p>

<p>Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know throws it back to tomorrow--a triple play.</p>

<p>Abbott: Yeah, it could be.</p>

<p>Costello: Another guy gets up and it&#39;s a long ball to center.</p>

<p>Abbott: Because.</p>

<p>Costello: Why? I don&#39;t know. And I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Abbott: What was that?</p>

<p>Costello: I said, I DON&#39;T CARE!</p>

<p>Abbott: Oh, that&#39;s our shortstop!</p>

	<p>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing.</p>

<p>Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,&mdash;though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,&mdash;in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:&mdash;through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.</p>

<p>And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye!&mdash;Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe."</p>

<p>And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden light:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly!"</p>

<p>And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been welded.</p>

<p>It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.</p>

<p>The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.</p>

<p>As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.</p>
