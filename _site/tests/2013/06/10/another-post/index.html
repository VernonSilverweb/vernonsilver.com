  <div class="entry-content prose">
    <p>As co-chairs of the House Sovereignty Caucus, we are concerned about the impact the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Disabilities Treaty) will have on U.S. sovereignty and freedom. Reports have been circulating that the U.S. Senate plans to consider the Disabilities Treaty in early November even though it was defeated in the 112th Congress. We believe that joining the treaty will not enhance the rights of Americans with disabilities nor advance U.S. national interests abroad. Instead, the treaty’s vague definitions of “disability” and “sexual and reproductive health” invite abuse and the furtherance of abortion as a right, and Article 7 threatens Americans’ parental rights. </p>

<p>The Disabilities Treaty establishes a body of unaccountable experts, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which evaluates the compliance of state parties to the treaty every four years, and issues recommendations for how they might improve in fulfilling their obligations. We are concerned that joining the treaty will allow foreign experts to interfere with U.S. policymaking and violate the principles of U.S. sovereignty. Too often U.N. treaty bodies seek to broaden the scope of the treaties that created them through treaty monitoring bodies, which expand language in original agreements and disregard national sovereignty.</p>

<p>Additionally, we find the language in the treaty especially concerning because it lacks concise definitions of very important terms. For example, the Disabilities Treaty lacks a clear definition of “disability,” which it defines as an evolving concept. This ambiguity invites abuse by persons or groups that do not suffer from a recognized medical disability but seek resources and protection under the authority of the treaty. This could also result in complicating the implementation of the treaty in the United States.</p>

<p>Although the treaty’s main purpose seeks to ensure the rights and protections of the disabled, the Disabilities Treaty includes the issue of sexual and reproductive health, which some U.N. staff has interpreted as “abortion rights.” While the nations who negotiated the treaty expressly rejected that interpretation, there is reason to believe the treaty monitoring body will read a right to abortion into the treaty like other treaty monitoring bodies have done for treaties that do not even include the controversial phrase. Abortion advocates and U.N. staff have already pointed to the Disabilities Treaty as a means to further build their case in favor of abortion as a human right. We strongly oppose this.</p>

<p>We are also concerned that Article 7 of the treaty would give the federal government the ability to override the decisions of parents of disabled children if the government believes its views are in the best interest of the child. This could strip parents of fundamental rights, including the ability to home school their children with disabilities if they believe it is in the best interests of their child. We support the rights of the disabled within the U.S., and the U.S. already holds itself to a high standard of human rights. We believe that the rights of Americans with disabilities are well protected under existing law and are enforced by a range of state and federal agencies.</p>

<p>Any modification or expansion of protections to Americans with disabilities should be achieved through the legislative process – not through an international treaty. Allowing an international panel of disability experts to scrutinize the U.S. record every four years could result in many unintended consequences for U.S. interests, yielding little or no benefit in realizing disability rights for Americans.</p>

<p>All in all, we believe that U.S. ratification of the Disabilities Treaty would not advance U.S. national interests abroad or the rights of Americans with disabilities here at home. This treaty would subject the U.S. to further intrusion by U.N. officials into policies that are sensitive domestic and social issues, and we remain convinced that the risks to the U.S. posed by this treaty far outweigh any potential benefits that could be realized by U.S. ratification.</p>

	<p>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing.</p>

<p>Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,&mdash;though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,&mdash;in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:&mdash;through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.</p>

<p>And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye!&mdash;Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe."</p>

<p>And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden light:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly!"</p>

<p>And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been welded.</p>

<p>It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.</p>

<p>The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.</p>

<p>As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.</p>
