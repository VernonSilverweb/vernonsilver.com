    <p>Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let&#39;s get started.</p>

<p>On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options ofÂ <em>None</em>,Â <em>Left</em>,Â <em>Right, </em>andÂ <em>Center</em>. In addition, they also get the options ofÂ <em>Thumbnail</em>,Â <em>Medium</em>,Â <em>Large</em>Â &amp;Â <em>Fullsize</em>.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-906 aligncenter" title="Image Alignment 580x300" alt="Image Alignment 580x300" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" width="580" height="300" /></p>
The image above happens to beÂ <em><strong>centered</strong></em>.</p>

<p><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-904 alignleft" title="Image Alignment 150x150" alt="Image Alignment 150x150" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></strong>The rest of this paragraph is fillerÂ for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.Â <strong></strong></p>

<p>&quot;As you can see the should be some space above&quot;, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one moreÂ sentenceÂ here, we&#39;ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image inÂ seamlessÂ transition. Again, letting the do it&#39;s thang.Â Mission accomplished!</p>

<p>And now for a <em><strong>massively large image</strong></em>. It also has <em><strong>no alignment</strong></em>.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-907" title="Image Alignment 1200x400" alt="Image Alignment 1200x400" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg" width="1200" height="400" /></p>

<p>The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-905 alignright" title="Image Alignment 300x200" alt="Image Alignment 300x200" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>

<p>And now we&#39;re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don&#39;t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don&#39;t let anyone else tell you differently.</p>

<p>In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty.Â Yeah... Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.</p>

<p>And just when you thought we were done, we&#39;re going to do them all over again with captions!</p>

<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_906&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;580&quot;]<img class="size-full wp-image-906  " title="Image Alignment 580x300" alt="Image Alignment 580x300" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" width="580" height="300" /> Look at 580x300 getting some <a title="Image Settings" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/images/image-settings/">caption</a> love.[/caption]</p>

<p>The image above happens to beÂ <em><strong>centered</strong></em>. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.</p>

<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_904&quot; align=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;150&quot;]<img class="size-full wp-image-904  " title="Image Alignment 150x150" alt="Image Alignment 150x150" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /> Itty-bitty caption.[/caption]</p>

<p><strong></strong>The rest of this paragraph is fillerÂ for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned</strong></em>.Â <strong></strong></p>

<p>As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too.

<p>The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.</p>

<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_905&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;]<img class="size-full wp-image-905 " title="Image Alignment 300x200" alt="Image Alignment 300x200" src="http://wpthemetestdata.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /> Feels good to be right all the time.[/caption]</p>

<p>And now we&#39;re going to shift things to the <em><strong>right align</strong></em>. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there... Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don&#39;t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don&#39;t let anyone else tell you differently.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s a wrap, yo! You survived theÂ tumultuousÂ waters of alignment. Image alignment achievement unlocked!</p>

	<p>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing.</p>

<p>Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,&mdash;though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,&mdash;in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause:&mdash;through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.</p>

<p>And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye!&mdash;Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do believe."</p>

<p>And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden light:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly!"</p>

<p>And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been welded.</p>

<p>It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.</p>

<p>The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.</p>

<p>As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain's and officers' state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.</p>
