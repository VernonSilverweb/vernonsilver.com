The knotty new legal troubles for Led Zeppelin is the subject of Bloomberg News reporter Vernon Silver's recent piece, "Stairway To Heaven: The Song Remains Pretty Similar." In a conversation with Soundcheck host John Schaefer, Silver plays the source material in question -- 1968's "Taurus" by Randy California's band Spirit -- and examines the case to be made that California's estate is entitled to a portion of the royalties from "Stairway To Heaven."
