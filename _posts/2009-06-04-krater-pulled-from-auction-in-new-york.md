U.S. Customs says a krater got yanked from auction in New York, in part because of its possible link to a certain Roman art dealer:

“The investigation into the Corinthian column krater revealed it may have been illegally introduced into the art market by Giacomo Medici and a third party at Sotheby’s Auction house in 1985.”
